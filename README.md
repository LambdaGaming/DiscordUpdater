# DiscordUpdater
 Script that automatically downloads and installs Discord updates on Linux.

# Features
- Currently only works with tar.gz installs, support for deb installs is planned
- If Discord is found in the current working directory, the script will install the update to that location, otherwise it will prompt the user to enter a path
- The script will terminate if the download fails for whatever reason
