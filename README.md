# DiscordUpdater
 Script that automatically downloads and installs Discord updates on Linux.

# Features
- Supports both tar.gz and deb installations
- For a tar.gz installation, if Discord is found in the current working directory, the script will install the update to that location, otherwise it will prompt the user to enter a path
- The script will terminate if the download fails for whatever reason
